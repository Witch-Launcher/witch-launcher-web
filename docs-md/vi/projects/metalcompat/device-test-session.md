## 0. Requirements

- iPhone 8 Plus (A11), any iOS 14+ (record exact OS version per run —
  on iOS 16+ the device additionally advertises MTLGPUFamilyMetal3).
- Mac host: this repo, Xcode 26.3.
- Apple Developer account for device signing.

## 1. Prepare (done once)

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-ios-xcode -G Xcode \
  -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphoneos \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0
open build-ios-xcode/MetalCompat.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode: select each app target (MC_CapabilityReport, MC_BasicRender) →
Signing & Capabilities → check "Automatically manage signing" + your team.

## 2. Run per device (repeat for each phone)

1. Plug the phone, choose it as the run destination.
2. Select target **MC_CapabilityReport** → Run (Release for signed install also
   works with CODE_MARKETING or Development config as Xcode decides).
3. Copy the **full console output** into a file:
   `docs/testlogs/<deviceModel>_<iOSVersion>_capability.txt`.
4. Same for **MC_BasicRender** (`..._basicrender.txt`).

## 3. What we must record (per SPEC 12.1)

| Item | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| Device model + OS build | `Settings > General > About` (+ console header line from the app) |
| SoC/GPU family evidence | app line `families: ...` (A11 expects `Apple4,...`) |
| Capability limits | app lines for maxBufferLength, threadgroups, tiers |
| Test date | filename + commit hash note |
| Result + logs | the two txt files above |

## 4. Expected console landmarks (A11, iOS 14/15)

```text
families          : Apple1,Apple2,Apple3,Apple4,Common1,Common2,Common3 ← must include Apple4
metal4 (family 5002) : no
PLAN mtl4.queue   -> REFUSED UnavailableOs ...                      ← D-008 enforced on hardware
PLAN pipe.render  -> Native ...                                     ← legacy slice usable
[BASICRENDER] deterministic frame matches reference (≥97% gate)     ← M3 gate on-device
```

iOS 16+ on A11 adds: `metal3 (family 5001) : yes` (Metal3 runtime availability
row lands the same way).

If any landmark differs → STOP, open an issue, do not patch the registry by
hand (change protocol §0).

## 5. After the session (agent's job, on receiving logs)

1. Update `docs/TESTING.md` device matrix: Apple4 row → `physical-validated via
   A11 (iPhone 8 Plus, iOS <ver>, date, logs)`.
2. Fill `registry/gpu_capabilities.json` `deviceMatrix.validatedPhysical`.
3. Resolve open questions that the logs answer:
   R-1 (tessellation gate — needs a follow-up tessellation probe run),
   R-3 (argumentBuffersTier value),
   R-4 (MSL version actually accepted — the BasicRender compile result shows it).
4. Re-run registry validator + unit tests; commit with the logs.

## 6. Session 2+ (later, after the A11 session)

- Tessellation probe (R-1): small app creating a tessellation render pipeline
  on A11 — resolves the Apple4 hardware gate row (A11 supports the API; the
  hardware gate row governs).
- A10 (iPhone 7/X): starts the Apple3 family row physical validation.
- A9 handset whenever available: same two apps; moves the A9 silicon column,
  the SPEC's core target.

| GPU family | SoCs | OS floor used by MetalCompat baseline |
|---|---|---|
| Apple1 | A7 | n/a |
| Apple2 | A8 | n/a |
| **Apple3** | **A9, A10** | **iOS 14 (primary target)** |
| Apple4 | A11 | iOS 14 |
| Apple5 | A12 | iOS 14 |
| Apple6 | A13 | iOS 14 |
| Apple7 | A14 / M1 | iOS 14 |
| Apple8 | A15 / A16 / M2 | iOS 14–17 |
| Apple9 | A17 / M3 / M4 | iOS 17+ |
| Apple10 / Apple11 | newer generations | iOS 26-era tools |
| Mac2 | Intel Macs | macOS |
| Metal3 (5001) | Apple7+ class devices | iOS 16+ / macOS 13+ |
| Metal4 (5002) | MTL4-class devices | iOS 26+ / macOS 26+ |

## 3. Hardware-gated features — Apple-family expectations

These are **hypotheses marked UNKNOWN until probed**, except where Apple
documentation states the map (family↔docs mapping above). The Capability Engine
(M2) must resolve each by runtime query on real hardware:

| Feature | Apple3 (A9/A10) | Apple4 (A11) | Apple5 (A12) | Apple6 (A13) | Apple7 (A14/M1) | Evidence basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Imageblocks / tile shaders | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | YES (docs-adjacent; to probe) | docs M7 task |
| Mesh shading | UNKNOWN (R-2) | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | YES (docs-adjacent) | legacy path research |
| Ray tracing (`MTLAccelerationStructure`) | UNKNOWN→expected NO (R-1 probes) | UNKNOWN→expected NO | UNKNOWN→expected NO | YES-expected (A13 family docs association) | YES-expected | OS API available iOS 14; hardware support must be probed |
| Tessellation | UNKNOWN (R-1) | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | registry R-1 |
| Read-write texture tier 2 | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | runtime query |
| Argument buffers Tier 2 | UNKNOWN (expect Tier 1) | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | R-3 |
| `MTLCommandBuffer_TYPE_RAY_TRACING` encoders | NO-expected | NO-expected | NO-expected | YES-expected | YES-expected | docs/runtime |

Rule (SPEC D-005/D-006): a cell stays `UNKNOWN` until the real device query has
run. No inference from generation names replaces the probe.

## 4. Per-device limits (runtime queries, not doc-derived)

The registry stores limit *slots* to fill per device at runtime during M2/M3:

- `maxBufferLength`
- `maxThreadgroupMemoryLength` (and `maxTotalThreadgroupMemoryLength`)
- `maxThreadsPerThreadgroup` (x/y/z)
- `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`
- `currentAllocatedSize` ceilings per heap
- texture stack depth, per-color attachments (maxColorRenderTargets by OS)
- `MTLReadWriteTextureTier`, `MTLArgumentBuffersTier`
- `maximumSamplerCount`, `maxTessellationFactorAmplification`

These queries are all iOS ≤14 era public `MTLDevice` properties (verified
availability in RESEARCH §4); values differ per device and are recorded at
runtime in the capability report — **never hard-coded per SoC**.

## 5. Host development environment capability (measured 2026-10-30)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Host device | Intel UHD Graphics 630 (iMac20,1), system-reported “Metal 3” support |
| Family expectation | `MTLGPUFamilyMac2` (runtime probe in M2 will confirm) |
| Value for the project | Can compile/run all CPU-only tests + render vertical slice (non-Apple GPU); can NOT validate any Apple-family-specific behavior |

## 6. A9 validation status

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| A9 reports `supportsFamily(MTLGPUFamilyApple3)` | **PENDING** (docs-supported, runtime proof required on hardware) |
| A9 cannot report `MTLGPUFamilyMetal4` | PENDING (OS/family gates make it logically impossible, but device test still required before PHYSICAL-VALIDATED status) |
| Deterministic frame render on A9 | **PENDING** (`docs/TESTING.md` device matrix) |

## 7. M5–M8 matrix additions (2026-10-30)

| Feature | Apple3 (A9/A10) | Apple4 (A11) | Apple5+ | macOS-family | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| render.layered (RT array length + per-draw layer) | FALLBACK (per-slice passes) | FALLBACK | NATIVE | NATIVE | official article + tables May 21, 2026 |
| res.textureView (slice views) | NATIVE | NATIVE | NATIVE | NATIVE | iOS 9.0+/macOS 10.11+ selectors |
| trans.mtl4.argtable.tier1 (argument buffers, tier-1) | PARTIAL (TIer1 expected; probe pending device) | PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL | selectors iOS 11.0+; tier reported at runtime |
| cmd.renderBarrierStageLimit (.fragment/.tile/renderTargets barriers) | UNSUPPORTED | UNSUPPORTED | UNSUPPORTED (Apple3–10) | TAS - see note | footnote 3, May 21, 2026 tables |
| pipe.mesh.legacy (mesh shading) | UNSUPPORTED | UNSUPPORTED | UNSUPPORTED (Apple7+) | UNSUPPORTED | tables (mesh row Apple7+) |
| pipe.tessellationFactor (max 16) | NATIVE (factor 16) | NATIVE | NATIVE | PARTIAL (macOS floor unstudied) | Apple3 column, tables |

Note: Mac2/Intel includes the layer-selection rule only via the macOS-family
branch; device-specific refusals come from the runtime-resolved token.
